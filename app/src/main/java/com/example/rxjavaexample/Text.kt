She'dheard about it from many people, and today she would be finding out for herself.A big, smiling man with Andy Carstairs embroidered on his blue overallsapproached her. It was the boss himself, welcoming customers. What a nice touch!'Hi, call me Andy,' he invited.'I'm Becky Phillips.' Her hand was enfolded in a warm, bear-like grasp.'I have abooking. Several things need attention –––but I've just been too busy.'Andy Carstairs looked deep into Becky's eyes and took his time letting go ofher hand.'I understand,' he said in a velvety bass voice,'there comes a time whenwe can't put it off any longer.'Laying on the charm a bit thick, wasn't he? thought Becky. Not that sheminded.'If you'll step this way?' continued Andy. He spread one hand invitingly whilesnapping the fingers of the other like a head-waiter at a swanky restaurant. A youngmechanic darted forward and drove Becky's little Ford into an inspection bay.'I think I need a new exhaust,' announced Becky.Andy nodded. Positioned onto a car lift, her vehicle was whooshed up on acushion of compressed air.'Tom says only half of it needs replacing right now,' said Andy after consultingwith his mechanic.'I'd rather have the whole system replaced,' replied Becky,'otherwise I'll have tocome back in six months to get the other half fitted.' Andy inclined his headadmiringly at her wisdom. He quoted a price.'Is that good quality?' asked Becky.Andy looked offended.'The best,' he assured her.'That's fantastic. I'm sure I paid a lot more last time around.''We aim to please,' murmured Andy.'How else can we serve you?'How about taking me out to dinner? If only she could say that! Becky sighed asAndy caressed her with his eyes. She'd broken up with her boyfriend a couple ofmonths ago, and it felt great to be basking in the warmth of an attractive man'sattention. Like downing a large cognac in a single swallow, Becky decided.'I think the windscreen wipers need replacing,' Becky told Andy.Her car descended to earth and the slim rubber blades were carefullyinspected.'No worries. They're fine,' said Andy.\n" +
        "Becky nodded.'Okay, but I'd like the spark plugs changed. I'm having troublestarting in the mornings.''We'll check the points too,' promised Andy,'and maybe a new air filter wouldhelp –––they aren't expensive.''Fine. I don't mind paying to avoid car hassle,' agreed Becky.'Now. How else can we be of help?' enquired Andy with a polite smile. He hadto be aware of the effect of his charm, but he was thoughtfully keeping his distance.'Thanks, but I think I'm done,' Betty told him reluctantly. She'd been enjoyingherself but it was clear that Andy was determined not to let her waste her money.But instead of being pleased at her treatment, Becky found herself feelinguneasy and confused. How often did any garage treat its customers with suchfairness and consideration?She'd come to Carstairs' Garage on the strength of the claims being madeabout it, but she hadn't bargained on being waited upon like a queen. Surely this wastoo good to be true?And more was to follow.'It's not a big job, we'll have it done while you wait,' Andy was saying,'meanwhile please make yourself comfortable in our hospitality room.''This really is too kind of you....are you sure?' began Becky anxiously, but Andyhad already placed a gentle but firm arm around her waist and was ushering herforward.The room itself was large and luxurious. Real coffee was on offer. Becky wasimpressed. Of course Andy couldn't stay, it would be silly to expect that. Besides,she had just heard someone shouting for him in the workshop.Andy heard it too, and for the first time he seemed irritated.'I won't be long,' he assured Becky before hurrying away.Becky leafed through a magazine, daydreaming about what it would feel like tohave Andy holding her close in his strong arms.After a while his mechanic, Tom, knocked on the door.'All done,' he informed Becky.She examined the bill carefully but couldn't fault it. This was unreal!'Where's Andy?' asked Becky.'Oh, he's around,' said Tom vaguely.She paid and Tom handed back her car keys. Following him to her waiting carBecky couldn't help feeling that she was leaving unfinished business behind.\n" +
        "She thanked Tom and started the engine. Tom waved and walked away. Beckythen switched off the engine and climbed out. She had to see Andy. Maybe you'rehoping he'll ask you for a date? said a jeering voice inside her head which sheignored.Earlier Becky had seen a door marked \"manager\", and reaching it she knockedtimidly. The door swung open. There was no one inside. She decided to wait forAndy.After a while her gaze idly strayed to Andy's desk. Suddenly Becky felt anunpleasant jolt of shock. In a little photo frame was the portrait of a beautiful girlroughly her own age. Andy's girlfriend. It had to be. Becky's heart sank to the bottomof her smart high-heeled shoes. How stupid she'd been!As she blundered out of the office she saw Andy coming towards her. Beckybegan to run.'Becky, wait –––I can explain,' shouted Andy.But Becky kept straight on. She got to her car and drove away without abackward glance. Her foolish heart had blinded her to the truth. She vowed it wouldnever happen again.When Becky got back to her office she went straight to her personal assistant'sdesk. The girl looked up.'Mandy, you're fired,' Becky calmly announced.Then she turned and walked into her own, more private office through a frostedglass window marked Trading Standards Officer. Briefly she touched a pile ofcomplaints from customers claiming they had been ripped off by Carstairs' Garage.'I knew it was too good to be true,' sighed Becky. It was meant to have been asurprise visit, but Andy had been warned she was coming. Through the half opendoor Becky saw that Andy's girlfriend was already clearing her desk."
